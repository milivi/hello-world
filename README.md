# hello-world
First time on GitHub!
I'm returning to school for a second bachelor's degree, this time in computer science! 
The first was in Spanish with a minor in computer science. 
I'm committing myself to learning in and out of the classroom!
I've worked mostly in Java and SQL server, right now I'm working my way into Python.
